==COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS==
run make in source directory with all files listed in File Manifest

==OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS==
In directory with xbd executable run

./xbd -b filepath
for binary output and 

./xbd filepath
for hexadecimal output

==DESIGN DECISIONS==
We read in the command line file into an unsigned character array.

If no flag is given we print the characters as hexidecimal by
converting the chars to integers with the int() cast, then convert
the int number to hex using cout << formatting functions.

If the binary flag is given we print the character as binary by
converting the chars to integers with the int() cast, then convert
the integer number using a homemade numToBinary function which 
returns a binary byte string.

==LESSONS LEARNED==
We learned that how you store the file bytes is very important. At first,
we stored the data as signed characters in ASCII, but then realized our mistake
when trying our program on picture files.
